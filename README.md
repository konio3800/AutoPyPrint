# AutoPyPrint
AutoPyPrint is a Free Python script for printing files directly to a Local printer on Windows Based OS, This script is meant to be used without the need of expensive automation programs like FolderMill, AutoPrint or Bartender.

It currently has a very early implementation of the process and its only compatible with TXT printing. It is currrenty deployed in a production enviroment using "NSSM - the Non-Sucking Service Manager" to run as a service. 
So far it is working flawlessly for our needs.
Next step will be to make it avalible for more printing types.
